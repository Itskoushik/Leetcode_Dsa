# LeetCode #191: Number of 1 Bits  
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)  

## Problem Statement ðŸŸ¢ **Difficulty:** Easy  
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the **Hamming Weight**).  

###  Example 1  
```python
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The input binary string `00000000000000000000000000001011` has **three '1' bits**.
```
### Example 2
``` python
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000  
Output: 1  
Explanation: The input binary string `00000000000000000000000010000000` has **one '1' bit**.
```
### Example 3
```python

Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101  
Output: 31  
Explanation: The input binary string has **thirty-one '1' bits**.
```
### Constraints
```pgsql

- The input must be a 32-bit unsigned integer.
```

### Approach: Bit Manipulation (Brian Kernighan's Algorithm)

The key idea is to use Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm, which efficiently counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.

Whenever we perform n & (n - 1), it removes the rightmost 1-bit in n.
We repeat this operation until n becomes 0, counting the number of times it runs.

### Time Complexity
```
O(k), where k is the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.
Since n is a 32-bit integer, the worst case runs O(32) â‰ˆ O(1) time.
```
### Space Complexity
```
O(1), as we use only a few integer variables.
```
