# ðŸ“Œ LeetCode #153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array 
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)  

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement  ðŸŸ¡ **Difficulty:** Medium
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

### ðŸ”¹ Example 1:  
```python
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```
### ðŸ”¹ Example 2:  

```python
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```
### ðŸ”¹ Example 3:  

```python
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
```
Constraints:
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000

```
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

## ðŸš€ Solution Explanation  

### ðŸ”´ **Brute Force Approach** (O(nÂ²))  
A naive approach would be to iterate through all possible subarrays and compute their product.  
- Start at each index and multiply it with the next elements, keeping track of the maximum product.  
- This results in a **time complexity of O(nÂ²)**, which is inefficient for large inputs.  

### ðŸŸ¢ **Optimized Approach (O(n))**  
To improve efficiency, we use a **dynamic tracking method** to handle both **positive and negative numbers** effectively.  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Key Observations**  
1. **Tracking Maximum & Minimum Products**  
   - Since multiplying a negative number with a small (negative) product can make it large, we track both the **maximum (`curmax`) and minimum (`curmin`)** products at each step.  
   - For each number, we calculate:  
     ```python
     curmax = max(n * curmax, n * curmin, n)
     curmin = min(temp, n * curmin, n)
     ```
   - This ensures we correctly handle cases where negatives flip signs.  

2. **Handling Zeroes**  
   - If `0` is encountered, multiplying further would result in zero.  
   - To prevent `curmax` and `curmin` from being permanently affected, we reset them to `1` whenever a `0` appears.  

#### âœ… **Time Complexity: O(n)**  
Since we traverse the array only **once**, the solution runs in **linear time**, making it highly efficient.

## ðŸ”¢ **Example Dry Run**  
### Example: `nums = [2,3,-2,4]`  

| Step | `n` | `curmax` | `curmin` | `res` |
|------|----|--------|--------|------|
| 1st Iteration | 2 | **2** | **2** | **2** |
| 2nd Iteration | 3 | **6** | **3** | **6** |
| 3rd Iteration | -2 | **-2** | **-12** | **6** |
| 4th Iteration | 4 | **4** | **-48** | **6** |

**Final Output: `6`** âœ…

This approach ensures we efficiently find the **maximum product subarray** in just **O(n) time complexity**. ðŸš€
