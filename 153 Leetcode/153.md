#  LeetCode #153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array 
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)  

##  Problem Statement  ðŸŸ¡ **Difficulty:** Medium
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

### ðŸ”¹ Example 1:  
```python
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```
### ðŸ”¹ Example 2:  

```python
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```
### ðŸ”¹ Example 3:  

```python
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
```
Constraints:
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000

```
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

 Solution Explanation

 Brute Force Approach (O(n))

A simple way to solve this problem is to iterate through the entire array and find the minimum element.

However, this approach takes O(n) time, which is not optimal.

 Optimized Approach: Binary Search (O(log n))

Since the array is sorted but rotated, we can use binary search to efficiently locate the minimum element in O(log n) time.

ðŸ”¹ Algorithm

Initialize Two Pointers:
```
left = 0, right = len(nums) - 1
```

Perform Binary Search:
```
While left < right:

Compute mid = (left + right) // 2

If nums[mid] > nums[right]:
```
The minimum must be in the right half, so set left = mid + 1

Else:

The minimum must be in the left half or at mid, so set right = mid

Return nums[left] as the minimum element

 Time Complexity: O(log n)

Since we perform a binary search, the time complexity is O(log n).
