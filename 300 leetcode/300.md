# LeetCode #300: Longest Increasing Subsequence  
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)  

## Problem Statement ðŸŸ¡ Difficulty: Medium  
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the **longest strictly increasing subsequence**.  

A subsequence is a sequence derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.  

### Example 1:  
**Input:** `nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is `[2,3,7,101]`, so the length is `4`.  

### Example 2:  
**Input:** `nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]`  
**Output:** `4`  

### Example 3:  
**Input:** `nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`  
**Output:** `1`  

### Constraints:  
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`  
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Approach  
### ðŸ”¹ **Dynamic Programming (O(nÂ²) Approach)**  
We use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to track the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.  

### **Steps:**  
1. **Initialize DP Array:**  
   - Create an array `LIS` of the same length as `nums`, where each element starts with `1` (minimum LIS length).  

2. **Iterate Backwards:**  
   - Traverse `nums` from right to left (reverse order).  
   - For each index `i`, check all elements after it (`j > i`).  
   - If `nums[i] < nums[j]`, update `LIS[i] = max(LIS[i], 1 + LIS[j])`.  

3. **Return the Maximum LIS:**  
   - The final result is `max(LIS)`, which gives the length of the longest increasing subsequence.  

## Complexity Analysis 
- **Time Complexity:** `O(nÂ²)` (Nested loops iterate over `nums`).  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (Extra space for `LIS` array).
