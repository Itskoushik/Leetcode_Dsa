# ğŸ“Œ LeetCode #152: Maximum Product Subarray  
ğŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)  

## ğŸš€ Problem Statement  
Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous subarray that has the largest product and return the product.  
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit integer**.  

### ğŸ”¹ Example 1:  
```python
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
