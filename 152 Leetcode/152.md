#  LeetCode #152: Maximum Product Subarray  
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)  


##  Problem Statement  ðŸŸ¡ **Difficulty:** Medium
Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous subarray that has the largest product and return the product.  
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit integer**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Example 1:  
```python
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```
### ðŸ”¹ Example 2:  

```python
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```
Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
```
The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

##  Solution Explanation  

###  **Brute Force Approach** (O(nÂ²))  
A naive approach would be to iterate through all possible subarrays and compute their product.  
- Start at each index and multiply it with the next elements, keeping track of the maximum product.  
- This results in a **time complexity of O(nÂ²)**, which is inefficient for large inputs.  

###  **Optimized Approach (O(n))**  
To improve efficiency, we use a **dynamic tracking method** to handle both **positive and negative numbers** effectively.  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Key Observations**  
1. **Tracking Maximum & Minimum Products**  
   - Since multiplying a negative number with a small (negative) product can make it large, we track both the **maximum (`curmax`) and minimum (`curmin`)** products at each step.  
   - For each number, we calculate:  
     ```python
     curmax = max(n * curmax, n * curmin, n)
     curmin = min(temp, n * curmin, n)
     ```
   - This ensures we correctly handle cases where negatives flip signs.  

2. **Handling Zeroes**  
   - If `0` is encountered, multiplying further would result in zero.  
   - To prevent `curmax` and `curmin` from being permanently affected, we reset them to `1` whenever a `0` appears.  

####  **Time Complexity: O(n)**  
Since we traverse the array only **once**, the solution runs in **linear time**, making it highly efficient.

##  **Example Dry Run**  
### Example: `nums = [2,3,-2,4]`  

| Step | `n` | `curmax` | `curmin` | `res` |
|------|----|--------|--------|------|
| 1st Iteration | 2 | **2** | **2** | **2** |
| 2nd Iteration | 3 | **6** | **3** | **6** |
| 3rd Iteration | -2 | **-2** | **-12** | **6** |
| 4th Iteration | 4 | **4** | **-48** | **6** |

**Final Output: `6`**

This approach ensures we efficiently find the **maximum product subarray** in just **O(n) time complexity**. ðŸš€
