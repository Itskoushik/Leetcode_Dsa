# LeetCode #347: Top K Frequent Elements  
🔗 **Problem Link:** [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)  

## Problem Statement 🔴 Difficulty: Medium  
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in **any order**.  

### 🔹 Example 1:  
**Input:** `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`  

### 🔹 Example 2:  
**Input:** `nums = [1], k = 1`  
**Output:** `[1]`  

### Constraints:  
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`  
- `-10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 10⁴`  
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in nums]`.  
- The answer is **guaranteed** to be unique.

## Approach 
### 🔹 **Bucket Sort (O(n) Time, O(n) Space)**  
We can solve this problem efficiently using **bucket sort** instead of a heap-based solution.  

### **Steps:**  
1. **Count the occurrences** of each element using a **hashmap (`count`)**.  
2. **Use a frequency bucket array (`freq`)** where index `i` stores elements that appear `i` times in `nums`.  
3. **Traverse the `freq` array from the highest frequency to the lowest** to collect the `k` most frequent elements.  

### **Why Bucket Sort?**  
- Since the maximum possible frequency of any number is `len(nums)`, we create a **bucket array of size `n+1`**, where `n = len(nums)`.  
- This gives an **O(n) solution**, which is faster than `O(n log n)` solutions using sorting or heaps.

## Complexity Analysis ⏳  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  - Counting occurrences → `O(n)`  
  - Filling the bucket → `O(n)`  
  - Traversing the bucket → `O(n)` (in the worst case)  
  - **Overall: `O(n)`**  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  - Uses `O(n)` for the bucket array.
