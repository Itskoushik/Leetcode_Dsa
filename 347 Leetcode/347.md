# LeetCode #70: Climbing Stairs  
🔗 **Problem Link:** [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)  

## Problem Statement 🟢 Difficulty: Easy  
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.  

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?  

### 🔹 Example 1:  
**Input:** `n = 2`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top:  
1. `1 step + 1 step`  
2. `2 steps`  

### 🔹 Example 2:  
**Input:** `n = 3`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top:  
1. `1 step + 1 step + 1 step`  
2. `1 step + 2 steps`  
3. `2 steps + 1 step`  

### Constraints:  
- `1 <= n <= 45`

## Approach   
### 🔹 **Dynamic Programming (Optimized Fibonacci Approach - O(n) Time, O(1) Space)**  
This problem follows the **Fibonacci sequence** since the number of ways to reach step `n` is the sum of ways to reach steps `(n-1)` and `(n-2)`.  

### **Steps:**  
1. **Use two variables (`one` and `two`)** to store the number of ways to reach the last two steps:  
   - `one` → Stores ways to reach `(n-1)th` step.  
   - `two` → Stores ways to reach `(n-2)th` step.  

2. **Iterate from `0` to `n-2`** (since step `1` is already considered).  
   - Update `one` to be `one + two` (similar to Fibonacci formula).  
   - Shift `two` forward to hold the previous step's value.  

3. **Return `one`**, which contains the total ways to reach the `n`th step.

## Complexity Analysis ⏳  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (Iterates once through `n` steps).  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (Uses only two integer variables).
