House Robber Problem - Solution Explanation

Problem Statement

You are given an integer array nums representing the amount of money stored in each house. The constraint is that you cannot rob two adjacent houses. Your task is to determine the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

Solution Approach

The solution follows a dynamic programming approach where we maintain two variables:

rob1: Stores the maximum money robbed excluding the current house.

rob2: Stores the maximum money robbed including the current house.

At each house, we decide whether to rob it (adding its value to rob1) or skip it (keeping rob2 as is). We update the values accordingly for the next iteration.

Code Implementation

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize two variables to keep track of max money robbed
        rob1, rob2 = 0, 0  

        # Iterate through each house
        for n in nums:
            # Compute the max money that can be robbed at this step
            temp = max(n + rob1, rob2)
            
            # Update the values for the next iteration
            rob1 = rob2  # Previous max becomes second previous
            rob2 = temp  # Current max becomes previous max

        # Return the maximum amount that can be robbed
        return rob2  

Example Walkthrough

Consider the input:

nums = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]

We process each house as follows:

House

Money

rob1 (excluding)

rob2 (including)

New max

1st

2

0

2

max(2+0, 0) = 2

2nd

7

2

7

max(7+0, 2) = 7

3rd

9

7

11

max(9+2, 7) = 11

4th

3

11

11

max(3+7, 11) = 11

5th

1

11

12

max(1+11, 11) = 12

Final Output:

solution = Solution()
print(solution.rob([2, 7, 9, 3, 1]))  # Output: 12

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n) because we iterate through nums once.

Space Complexity: O(1) since only two variables (rob1, rob2) are used.

Edge Cases Considered

Empty List (nums=[]) → Output 0.

Single House (nums=[5]) → Output 5.

All Houses with Same Money (nums=[4,4,4,4]) → Optimal choice by skipping adjacent houses.
