Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters - README

Problem Statement

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Solution Approach

The solution uses the Sliding Window Technique with a Set to efficiently determine the longest substring without repeating characters.

Algorithm Steps:

Use a set (charSet) to store unique characters in the current window.

Maintain a left pointer (l) to track the start of the window.

Iterate through the string using a right pointer (r):

If s[r] is already in charSet, move the left pointer (l) right until s[r] is removed.

Add s[r] to charSet.

Update res with the maximum window size found so far.

Return res as the longest substring length.

Code Implementation

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Use a set to keep track of unique characters in the current window
        charSet = set()
        l = 0  # Left pointer of the sliding window
        res = 0  # Variable to store the longest substring length

        # Iterate through the string with the right pointer
        for r in range(len(s)):
            # If a duplicate character is found, move the left pointer
            while s[r] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[l])  # Remove leftmost character from the set
                l += 1  # Move the left pointer forward
            
            # Add the current character to the set
            charSet.add(s[r])
            # Update the maximum length of the substring
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        
        return res  # Return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters

Example Walkthrough

Example 1

Input:

s = "abcabcbb"

Steps:

Window expands: "a" -> "ab" -> "abc" (max length = 3)
Repeating 'a' found, move left pointer: "bca"
Continue expanding: "bca" -> "bcab" -> "bcabc" (no increase in max length)
Final longest substring length = 3

Output:

3  # ("abc")

Example 2

Input:

s = "bbbbb"

Output:

1  # ("b")

Example 3

Input:

s = "pwwkew"

Output:

3  # ("wke")

Time Complexity

O(n) because each character is processed at most twice (once added, once removed).

O(min(n, 26)) â‰ˆ O(1) space for charSet, assuming only lowercase English letters.

Edge Cases Considered

An empty string ("")

A string with all unique characters ("abcdef")

A string with all repeating characters ("aaaaaa")
