# LeetCode #338: Counting Bits  
🔗 **Problem Link:** [Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)  

## Problem Statement 🟢 **Difficulty:** Easy  
Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the **number of 1's** in the binary representation of `i`.  

###  Example 1  
```python
Input: n = 2  
Output: [0,1,1]  
Explanation:  
0 -> 0 (0 ones)  
1 -> 1 (1 one)  
2 -> 10 (1 one)
```
### Example 2
```python
Copy
Edit
Input: n = 5  
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]  
Explanation:  
0 -> 0   (0 ones)  
1 -> 1   (1 one)  
2 -> 10  (1 one)  
3 -> 11  (2 ones)  
4 -> 100 (1 one)  
5 -> 101 (2 ones)  
```
### Constraints
```
0 <= n <= 10^5
```
 Approach 1: Dynamic Programming (Most Significant Bit)

We can use previously computed values instead of recalculating the number of 1’s from scratch.

Key observation:
```
A number i has the same number of 1’s as i - 2^m, where 2^m is the largest power of 2 ≤ i.
Example:
5 (101) = 1 + (1 of 1)
6 (110) = 1 + (1 of 2)
```
Formula:

countBits
(
𝑖
)
=
1
+
countBits
(

−
largest power of 2
)
countBits(i)=1+countBits(i−largest power of 2)
