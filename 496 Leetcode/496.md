# Next Greater Element

## Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, the goal is to find the next greater element for each element in `nums1`, where the next greater element is the first larger number appearing after it in `nums2`. If no such number exists, return `-1`.

## Example
```python
nums1 = [4, 1, 2]
nums2 = [1, 3, 4, 2]
```
**Expected Output:**
```python
[-1, 3, -1]
```

## Solution Explanation
### Step 1: Create `nums1Idx` Dictionary
We create a dictionary to store the indices of elements in `nums1` for quick lookup:
```python
nums1Idx = {4: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
```

### Step 2: Initialize `res` Array
We initialize `res` with `-1` since we haven't found any next greater elements yet:
```python
res = [-1, -1, -1]
```

### Step 3: Process `nums2` Using a Stack
We iterate through `nums2 = [1, 3, 4, 2]`:

1. **Processing `1`**  
   - Stack is empty, so we add `1` to the stack.  
   - Since `1` is in `nums1Idx`, we push it onto the stack.  
   - **Stack:** `[1]`

2. **Processing `3`**  
   - `3` is greater than `1`, so we pop `1` from the stack.  
   - Update `res[1] = 3`.  
   - **Stack:** `[3]`  
   - **Updated `res`:** `[-1, 3, -1]`

3. **Processing `4`**  
   - `4` is greater than `3`, so we pop `3` from the stack.  
   - We add `4` to the stack.  
   - **Stack:** `[4]`  
   - **`res` remains unchanged:** `[-1, 3, -1]`

4. **Processing `2`**  
   - `2` is smaller than `4`, so we do nothing.  
   - Since `2` is in `nums1Idx`, we push it onto the stack.  
   - **Stack:** `[4, 2]`  
   - **`res` remains unchanged:** `[-1, 3, -1]`

### Step 4: Final Output
After processing `nums2`, the stack still contains `[4, 2]`, meaning there were no greater elements found for `4` and `2`. The final result:
```python
res = [-1, 3, -1]
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N + M)`, where `N` is the size of `nums1` and `M` is the size of `nums2`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(M)` for storing the stack and dictionary.
