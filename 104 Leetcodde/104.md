# `LeetCode #104`: *Maximum Depth of Binary Tree*

üîó **Problem Link:** [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## **Problem Statement**  üü¢ **Difficulty:** *Easy*
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its **maximum depth**.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

---

###  **Example 1:**
```python
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path is [3 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 7], which has a depth of 3.
```
###  **Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1, null, 2]
Output: 2
```
Constraints:
```
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥].
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
```
##Brute Force Approach: Recursive DFS
In this approach, we use a recursive function to traverse each node and determine the maximum depth.

Steps:
```
Base Case: If the root is None, return 0 because an empty tree has no depth.
Recursive Case:Recursively call maxDepth on root.left and root.right.
Take the maximum of both depths and add 1 (to count the current node).
```
O(N) - time complexity


###Optimal Solution: Iterative DFS (Using Stack)
We can also solve this problem using iterative DFS with a stack.

Approach:

Use a stack to track (node, depth) pairs.
```
Initialize max_depth = 0.
While the stack is not empty:
Pop a (node, depth) pair.
If the node is not None, update max_depth.
Push (node.left, depth+1) and (node.right, depth+1) onto the stack.
Return max_depth.
```

### Time complexity
O(N) - We process each node once.
