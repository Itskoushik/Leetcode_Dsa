# ðŸ“Œ LeetCode #33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement  ðŸŸ¡ **Difficulty:** Medium
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

### ðŸ”¹ Example 1:  
```python
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

### ðŸ”¹ Example 2:  
```python
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

### ðŸ”¹ Example 3:  
```python
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

### âœ… Constraints:
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
All values of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated at some pivot.
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4
```
