### LeetCode #70: Climbing Stairs
🔗 Problem Link: Climbing Stairs

## Problem Statement 🟢 Difficulty: Easy
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### Example 1
```python
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
### Example 2
```python
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

Approach 
🔹 Dynamic Programming (Optimized Fibonacci Approach - O(n) Time, O(1) Space)
This problem follows the Fibonacci sequence since the number of ways to reach step n is the sum of ways to reach steps (n-1) and (n-2).

Steps:
Use two variables (one and two) to store the number of ways to reach the last two steps:

one → Stores ways to reach (n-1)th step.
two → Stores ways to reach (n-2)th step.
Iterate from 0 to n-2 (since step 1 is already considered).

Update one to be one + two (similar to Fibonacci formula).
Shift two forward to hold the previous step's value.
Return one, which contains the total ways to reach the nth step.

Complexity Analysis 
Time Complexity: O(n) (Iterates once through n steps).
Space Complexity: O(1) (Uses only two integer variables).
