# LeetCode #235: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree  
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

## Problem Statement  ðŸŸ¡ **Difficulty:** Medium  
Given a **binary search tree (BST)**, find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of two given nodes `p` and `q`.

The **lowest common ancestor** is defined as:  
- The **lowest** node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

###  Example 1:
```python
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```
### Example 2:
```python

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself.
```
### Constraints:
```
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
- -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.
```
### Optimal Solution: BST Properties
```
Start at the root node of the BST.
Compare p and q values with root.val:
If both p and q are smaller than root.val, LCA is in the left subtree.
If both p and q are greater, LCA is in the right subtree.
If p and q lie on different sides (or one is the root), root is the LCA.
Repeat this process recursively or iteratively until we find the LCA.
```
