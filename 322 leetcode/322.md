###Step-by-Step Explanation
```
Step 1: Initialize DP Array

We create a dp array of size amount + 1, initialized with amount + 1 (an arbitrarily large value indicating impossible cases).

This array will store the minimum coins needed to form each amount from 0 to amount.

Example for Initialization

Suppose amount = 5, then initially:

dp = [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]  # Since amount + 1 = 6

This means that at the beginning, we assume every amount from 1 to 5 is impossible to form.

Step 2: Define Base Case

dp[0] = 0, because we need 0 coins to make an amount of 0.

Step 3: Iterate Over Each Amount

We loop from 1 to amount to compute the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.

Step 4: Iterate Over Each Coin

For each amount a, we try every coin c in the coins list.

If a - c >= 0, it means we can use this coin, and we update dp[a] using:

dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a - c])

This ensures that we take the minimum number of coins possible.

Step 5: Return the Result

If dp[amount] is still amount + 1, it means the amount cannot be formed, so we return -1.

Otherwise, dp[amount] contains the minimum number of coins required.

### Time and Space Complexity
```
Time Complexity: , where n = amount and m = len(coins).

Space Complexity: , due to the dp array storing results for all amounts up to amount.
```
