# Invert Binary Tree

## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree by swapping the left and right subtrees at every node.

## Example
### Input Tree:
```
    4
   / \
  2   7
 / \ / \
1  3 6  9
```
### Expected Output (Inverted Tree):
```
    4
   / \
  7   2
 / \ / \
9  6 3  1
```

## Step-by-Step Execution
### Step 1: Swap the Left and Right Subtrees of Root (4)
- Left subtree (2) becomes right subtree.
- Right subtree (7) becomes left subtree.

### Step 2: Recursively Invert Left Subtree (7)
- Swap left child (6) with right child (9).

### Step 3: Recursively Invert Right Subtree (2)
- Swap left child (1) with right child (3).

### Step 4: Complete Inversion
After inverting all nodes recursively, we get the final inverted tree.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree (recursion stack depth).
