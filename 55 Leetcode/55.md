# LeetCode #55: Jump Game
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

## Problem Statement  ðŸŸ¡ **Difficulty:** Medium
You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:  
```python
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: True
```
### Example 2:
```python
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: False
```
### Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
```
### Solution (Greedy Approach)
### Approach
We solve this problem using a Greedy Algorithm by iterating the array backwards. The goal is to determine whether we can jump from the first index to the last.

Start by assuming the last index as the goal.
Traverse the array backwards from the second-last index to the first.
If the current index + nums[i] (jump length) can reach or exceed the goal, update the goal to the current index.
If, by the end, the goal reaches index 0, return True (meaning we can reach the last index); otherwise, return False.
