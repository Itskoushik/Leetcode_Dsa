Problem Statement

Given an m x n grid, a robot starts at the top-left corner and can only move either right or down at any point in time. The robot tries to reach the bottom-right corner. Determine how many possible unique paths the robot can take.

Solution Approach

The solution uses Dynamic Programming (DP) with space optimization to efficiently calculate the number of unique paths.

Algorithm Steps:

Initialize a row:

The last row in the grid is initialized with all 1s since there is only one way to reach the bottom-right corner by moving right.

Iterate from bottom to top:

Create a new row and update each cell based on the sum of the right and bottom cell values.

The value of each cell represents the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner from that position.

Final result:

The first element of the computed row contains the total number of unique paths.

Code Implementation

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the last row with all elements as 1
        row = [1] * n  

        # Iterate over each row from bottom to top, except the last row
        for i in range(m - 1):
            # Create a new row to store computed values for the current row
            newRow = [1] * n  
            # Iterate from right to left, computing the number of unique paths
            for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1):  
                newRow[j] = newRow[j + 1] + row[j]  # Sum of right and bottom cells
            # Update row to the newly computed row
            row = newRow  

        # The top-left cell contains the total number of unique paths
        return row[0]

Example Walkthrough

Example 1

Input:

m = 3, n = 7

Steps:

Grid representation:
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Start computing from the second-to-last row:
- Each cell is calculated as right + bottom cell.

Final row values:
[28, 21, 15, 10, 6, 3, 1]

Output:

28

Example 2

Input:

m = 3, n = 2

Steps:

Grid representation:
[1, 1]
[1, 1]
[1, 0]

Final row values:
[3, 1]

Output:

3

Time Complexity

O(m * n) since we iterate through each cell once.

O(n) space complexity as we only store one row at a time.

Edge Cases Considered

Smallest grid (1x1)

Single row (1 x n)

Single column (m x 1)

Larger grids (m > 10, n > 10)
