# Level Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, return its level order traversal, where nodes are visited level by level from left to right.

## Definition of a Tree Node

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val  # Initialize node value
        self.left = left  # Initialize left child
        self.right = right  # Initialize right child
Solution Explanation
The levelOrder function performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal using a queue (deque) to traverse the tree level by level.

Code Implementation
python

Edit
from collections import deque  # Import deque for efficient queue operations
from typing import List, Optional  # Import type hints

class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []  # Result list to store level-wise node values

        q = deque()  # Initialize a queue for BFS traversal
        q.append(root)  # Add the root node to the queue

        while q:  # Continue until the queue is empty
            qlen = len(q)  # Get the number of nodes at the current level
            level = []  # List to store values of the current level
            
            for i in range(qlen):  # Process all nodes at the current level
                node = q.popleft()  # Remove the front node from the queue
                
                if node:  # If the node is not null
                    level.append(node.val)  # Add node value to the level list
                    q.append(node.left)  # Add left child to the queue
                    q.append(node.right)  # Add right child to the queue
            
            if level:  # If the level list is not empty (ignoring null levels)
                res.append(level)  # Append the level to the result list
        
        return res  # Return the final level order traversal result

Step-by-step Execution:
Initialize Queue: q = [1]
Process Level 1:
Dequeue 1, add its children [2, 3]
Level result: [1]
Process Level 2:
Dequeue 2, add its children [4, 5]
Dequeue 3, add its child [6]
Level result: [2, 3]
Process Level 3:
Dequeue 4 (no children)
Dequeue 5 (no children)
Dequeue 6 (no children)
Level result: [4, 5, 6]
Queue is empty, return result.
Output:

Time Complexity
Each node is visited once, so the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity
The queue stores at most one level of the tree, which in the worst case is O(N) (for a complete binary tree).
