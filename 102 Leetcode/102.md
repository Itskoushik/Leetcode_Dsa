# 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its **level order traversal**, where nodes are visited **level by level from left to right**.

## Example

### Example 1:

#### Input:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
#### Output:
```python
[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]
```
We use Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal using a queue (deque) to process nodes level by level.

Steps:
Initialize a queue (deque) with the root node.
Iterate while the queue is not empty:
Process all nodes at the current level.
Store their values in a temporary list.
Enqueue their left and right children (if they exist).
Append the level list to the final result.
Return the result list containing level-wise node values.


Complexity	Explanation
Time Complexity	O(N) - Each node is visited once
Space Complexity	O(N) - The queue holds at most one level of nodes
