# LeetCode #268: Missing Number  
ðŸ”— **Problem Link:** [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)  

## Problem Statement ðŸŸ¡ **Difficulty:** Easy  
Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number missing from the range.  

###  Example 1  
```python
Input: nums = [3,0,1]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: The numbers from 0 to 3 are [0,1,2,3]. Since 2 is missing, we return 2.
```
### Example 2
```python

Input: nums = [0,1]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: The numbers from 0 to 2 are [0,1,2]. Since 2 is missing, we return 2.
```
### Example 3
```python
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]  
Output: 8  
Explanation: The numbers from 0 to 9 are [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Since 8 is missing, we return 8
```
### Constraints
```sql
n == nums.length  
1 <= n <= 10^4  
0 <= nums[i] <= n  
All the numbers in nums are unique.
```
### How It Works
```
You start with res = n, where n is the length of nums. This accounts for the expected missing number.
You iterate over the array, adjusting res by adding (i - nums[i]).
This effectively computes the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum, leading to the missing number.
```
### Example Walkthrough
```python
nums = [3, 0, 1]  # The Missing number is 2
res = 3 (since n = len(nums) = 3)
Loop over nums:
i = 0, nums[0] = 3 â†’ res += (0 - 3) â†’ res = 0
i = 1, nums[1] = 0 â†’ res += (1 - 0) â†’ res = 1
i = 2, nums[2] = 1 â†’ res += (2 - 1) â†’ res = 2
Output: 2 âœ…
