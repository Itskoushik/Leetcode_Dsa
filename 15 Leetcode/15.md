#  LeetCode #15: 3Sum
🔗 **Problem Link:** [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

##  Problem Statement  🟡 **Difficulty:** Medium
Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that:

- `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`
- `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`
- The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### 🔹 Example 1:  
```python
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

### 🔹 Example 2:  
```python
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
```

### 🔹 Example 3:  
```python
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
```

###  Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 3000
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
```

## 🛠️ Solution Approach: Two-Pointer Technique

### **Brute Force Approach (Inefficient)**
- Iterate through each element (`a`) and check for two other elements (`b`, `c`) that sum up to zero.
- This results in an **O(n³)** time complexity, making it inefficient.

### **Optimized Approach (Two-Pointer Technique)**

1. **Sorting:**  
   - First, we **sort** the array. This helps in efficiently skipping duplicates and using a two-pointer approach.
  
2. **Iterating Over 'a' (First Element of Triplet):**  
   - We iterate over each number and use it as the first element `a`.  
   - To **avoid duplicates**, if `nums[i] == nums[i-1]`, we **skip** that iteration.

3. **Finding 'b' and 'c' Using Two Pointers:**  
   - Use **left (`l = i + 1`) and right (`r = len(nums) - 1`)** pointers to find the two other numbers (`b` and `c`).
   - Compute `threesum = a + nums[l] + nums[r]`:
     - If **sum > 0**, we **decrease** `r` (move right pointer left to reduce sum).
     - If **sum < 0**, we **increase** `l` (move left pointer right to increase sum).
     - If **sum == 0**, we found a valid triplet, so we **append** it to the result list.

4. **Handling Duplicates in 'b' and 'c':**  
   - After finding a valid triplet, we increment `l` (`l += 1`) but also **skip duplicates** by checking `nums[l] == nums[l-1]`.

### **Edge Case Handling:**  
- The condition `while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l - 1]: l += 1` ensures we **skip duplicate values** for `b` to avoid repeating triplets.

### **Final Complexity: O(n²)**
- Sorting takes **O(n log n)**.
- Two-pointer search takes **O(n)** inside a loop of **O(n)** iterations.
- Thus, the final complexity is **O(n²), much better than O(n³)**.
