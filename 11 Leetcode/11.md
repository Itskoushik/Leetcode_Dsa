#  LeetCode #11: Container With Most Water
🔗 **Problem Link:** [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Problem Statement  🟡 **Difficulty:** Medium
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### 🔹 Example 1:  

![Graphical Representation](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)

```python
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
### 🔹 Example 2:  
```python
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

### 🔹 Example 3:  
```python
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
```

###  Constraints:
```
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
```

## Brute Force Approach

In the brute force approach, we calculate the area for every possible pair of container boundaries.

### **Steps:**
1. Start with two pointers:  
   - `l` at the **beginning** (`index 0`).
   - `r` iterates from `l+1` to the **end of the list**.
2. Compute the **area** at each `(l, r)` pair:
   - `area = (r - l) * min(height[l], height[r])`
3. Update `max_area` if the new area is larger.
4. Repeat the process by incrementing `l` until the second-last position.
5. **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)` (since we check all possible pairs).

### **Brute Force Code in Python**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        n = len(height)
        
        for l in range(n):
            for r in range(l + 1, n):
                area = (r - l) * min(height[l], height[r])
                max_area = max(max_area, area)
        
        return max_area
```

## Optimal Solution: Two-Pointers Approach

To optimize our solution, we use the **Two Pointers technique**, which reduces the time complexity to **O(n)**.

### **Approach:**
1. **Initialize two pointers:**
   - `l` (left pointer) at the **start** (`index 0`).
   - `r` (right pointer) at the **end** (`index len(height) - 1`).
   
2. **While `l < r`, compute the area:**
   - `area = (r - l) * min(height[l], height[r])`
   - Update `max_area`:  
     ```python
     max_area = max(max_area, area)
     ```
   
3. **Move the pointer with the smaller height:**
   - If `height[l] < height[r]`, increment `l` (`l += 1`).
   - Else, decrement `r` (`r -= 1`).
   - **Why?**  
     - If the smaller height remains, it **limits the water capacity**, so we try to find a larger height by moving that pointer.

4. **Repeat until `l >= r`**, then return `max_area`.

### **Intuition:**
- **Key observation:** The **smaller height is the limiting factor** for water storage.  
- If we move the taller height, we may **lose a potential maximum area**, so we **only move the pointer pointing to the smaller height**.

### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n)** since we **only iterate through the array once**.
